ðŸš€ New Power BI Project: E-commerce Sales Dashboard
Body:
Excited to share a recent Power BI project where I built a comprehensive e-commerce sales dashboard! This dashboard turns raw sales data into actionable insights, providing a clear overview of business performance.

Key visualizations include:

Profitability Analysis: Tracks profit trends by month and sub-category to identify top-performing products and seasonal patterns.
Sales Performance: Breaks down sales by customer and state, revealing key clients and geographical strengths.

Customer Behavior: Analyzes payment mode and product category to understand what customers are buying and how they are paying.

Key Metrics: Features key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales, profit, quantity, and average order value.
This project sharpened my skills in data visualization, DAX, and creating a user-friendly interface that drives business decisions.
